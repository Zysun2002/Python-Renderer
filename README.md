# Alberta-Renderer
This project is part of my 3-month research internship program in the University of Alberta. 


## Introduction

This renderer is for learning purpose. You could learn how to implement a python renderer from scratch from this project.

The renderer is a expended python version of [Dmitry V. Sokolov](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer)'s tutorial on computer graphics and rendering. Besides including all the features introduced in his tutorial, the advance made in this version is:
1. This renderer is implemented in Python. This is because I hope to integrate it with some other rendering techniques (like neural rendering) in the future.
2. This renderer supports to render a scene with multiple objects. 
3. This renderer supports obj and mtl file format. This is because I found obj + mtl can be easily found on the internet and thus the renderer can render more 3D assets.

Though implemented using python, the renderer does not rely on high-level graphics library during rendering process. I gain fundamental knowledge about rendering and computer graphics during building my renderer step by step.

### Shadow mapping technique:
An easy way to make rendering more photo-realistic is to calculate more accurate shadow. By a two-pass rendering process, we could bake the shadow information in a shadow mapping previously before real rendering.








### Appendix
 The project is still ongoing.
